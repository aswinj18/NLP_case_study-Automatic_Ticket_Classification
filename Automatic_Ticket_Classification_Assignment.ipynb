By doing so, you can segregate these tickets into their relevant categories and, therefore, help in the quick resolution of the issue.\n\nYou will be doing topic modelling on the <b>.json</b> data provided by the company. Since this data is not labelled, you need to apply NMF to analyse patterns and classify tickets into the following five clusters based on their products/services:\n\n* Credit card / Prepaid card\n\n* Bank account services\n\n* Theft/Dispute reporting\n\n* Mortgages/loans\n\n* Others \n\n\nWith the help of topic modelling, you will be able to map each ticket onto its respective department/category. You can then use this data to train any supervised model such as logistic regression, decision tree or random forest. Using this trained model, you can classify any new customer complaint support ticket into its relevant department.","metadata":{"id":"rhR-ZUkwJrFn"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Pipelines that needs to be performed:\n\nYou need to perform the following eight major tasks to complete the assignment:\n\n1.

The original payment was approximately {$1400.00} which ballooned to over {$2800.00} per month. \\n\\nI requested a loan modification three times via mail to XXXX XXXX and spoke to them on the phone many times and only met with hostility.

See formal loan modification submitted by XXXX XXXX to XXXX mortgage by mail : ( Formal loan modification attached to this complaint attachment # 1 dated XX/XX/XXXX ). \\n\\nFinancial and business setback issues, with credit card debt, and other issues made any additional payments unmanageable. \\n\\nThe loan was finally assumed by JP Morgan Chase Bank : New loan # XXXX. \\n\\nI sent various letters to Chase bank and called them, but they were unwilling to make any loan modification on this Predatory Loan. \\n\\nI employed a loan modification company ( XXXX XXXX, XXXX ) they contact the mortgage company but nothing was accomplished. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I composed a letter to Chase Bank and stated I could no longer make payments since they would not modify my loan. I realized this was the only way they would take any action ; stop paying. Chase verbally stated they would modify the loan but then refused to take any action.

In addition, Chase shows on my credit report : 120 days late for this mortgage # XXXX, and sold for less than value ( see attached copy of credit report attachment # 4 ). \\n\\nThis caused me to have credit accounts closed, and to pay very heavily for loans or not being able to obtain Mortgage and other loans.

All that needed to be done was to reverse that payment and my loan would have been fine because the {$1200.00} payment which drafted on XX/XX/XXXX would have satisfied my XXXX XXXX payment and would have me due for XXXX XXXX payment.

When I called, they said because I didn't call and ask them the balance, that was normal to charge interest on the balance during the month of XX/XX/XXXX that hadn't been billed, yet. I have never had a credit card charge extra interest after a balance is paid. I told them that made no sense, and they said it is the way they do business. I feel that is the same as charging interest on top of interest and should not be legal. I want my {$30.00} returned. I canceled the card, telling them I did not wish to do business with a company like that.\",\n   'My credit card company was offering a 12 month promotional 0 % balance transfer offer. I applied for an recieved a {$3000.00} balance transfer ; there was a 2 % fee, but there would be no interest on the {$3000.00} for 12 months. \\nI continued to use this credit card for purchases. \\nI paid off the entire balance of my new purchases However, the credit card number assessed me an interest charge on the entire balance, stating that \" you can not pay off only your purchase balance in full each month to avoid interest charges. If any part of the balance is carried forward into the next billing cycle, even at 0 % APR, the entire balance is considered to be a revolving balance ... \\'\\'')},\n {'topic_number': 9,\n  'top_10_complaint_samples': ('XXXX Chase mortgages have been resolved since 2009.

Chase will not verify that they sent it to the correct account. Of course Chase has charged me a fee too.',\n   'In its response to my CFPB complaint Chase made statements that are contradictory and do not represent actual facts. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/2018 CHASE had sent me a letter in my previous request to investigate the fact that my account is adversely affected ( I am not able to receive identification codes as text messages to my mobile phone number - a service that is advertised by Chase and that is available to other customers ). The fact was that my account was adversely affected due to the sole reason that Chase was not able to communicate to me via phone. \\n\\n1 ) In its response Chase made the following statement : \" On XX/XX/2018, you requested a document outlining a policy that states we wont assist customers that we cant communicate with by phone. We informed you that we have no such policy. \\'\\' In that same letter Chase also states : \" When a request comes through the SMC that requires subject matter expertise we will provide the contact information for the appropriate department to you and/or will forward the request to the appropriate line of business for follow up. When this occurs, these requests must be addressed by phone. \\'\\' Here Chase clearly sates that they will not address requests made in writing, which means that they do have a practice of not assisting customers with whom they can not communicate by phone. \\n\\nI would like to emphasize that during my communications with chase in writing I inquired multiple times about what specific information does Chase want me to communicate by phone and Chase had never provided me with any specific requests. \\n\\n2 ) Chase also wrote : \" On XX/XX/2018, we explained again that SMC specialists dont have the expertise to resolve your concern via the SMC. We advised you that we will continue to log your inquiries about this issue but will not respond further. \\'\\' I do believe that Chase is employing specialists that can address my concerns and the information that I provided to Chase in writing can be forwarded to those specialists with no significant expense to Chase. I would also like to emphasize one more time that I have not received any requests from Chase for any specific additional information from any of its departments. \\n\\n3 ). Chase also writes : \" Weve identified reasons your arent receiving our texts. Weve researched your concerns and identified reasons you arent receiving our texts. \\'\\' This information does not represent the actual facts. Chase has not identified any reasons why I wasn\\'t receiving text from Chase. Chase made some assumptions what possible causes might be and all those assumptions turned out to be false. I will address each one of them bellow. \\n\\n\" First, our system shows the current number on file is incorrect. \\'\\' My phone number on file with Chase is 100 % correct. I would appreciate that when Chase is making such claims about its system Chase provides factual evidence of that. What Chase \\'s system shows about my phone number was not provided in their response. To the contrary Chase had made several phone calls to my number through their automated system and through persons leaving voice mail on my accounts of which I informed Chase multiple times in XXXX time period - Chase should have take this into account when it was writing their response to avoid making false statements when true facts were available to them. \\n\\nChase writes : \" You will also be asked to provide global consent via Telephone Consumer Protection Act giving us permission to send you text messages. \\'\\' In my correspondence with Chase that was attached my CFPB complaint I informed Chase that I attempted to follow their instructions to provide Chase the necessary consent, but in order for me to provide such consent Chase \\'s system requested me to enter a code sent to me by Chase via a text message, which I have not received, of such fact I informed Chase in writing. \\n\\nI have to note that Chase did change the status of my phone on file with them to that of a Mobile phone, but after that I was still not receiving text messages with identification codes from Chase. \\n\\nChase writes : \" Second, please contact your service providers Tech Support team to confirm they are not blocking our short codes, XXXX and XXXX. \\'\\' I informed Chase that I contacted my service provider and confirmed that my service provider was not blocking short codes XXXX and XXXX. \\n\\nFurthermore, On XX/XX/2018 XXXX XXXX PDT after I texted the word \" help \\'\\' to XXXX I received a text message from XXXX that contained the following message : \" Chase Mobile Visit chase.com/mobile to activate or get info Reply STOP to end all account msgs to this # Msg & data rates may Apply \\'\\'. ( While visiting chase.com/mobile simply directs me to chase log in page where I can log in into my account, but there is no \" activate \\'\\' information on that site ). Of the fact that I was able to receive text messages from XXXX I informed chase in XX/XX/2018. \\n\\nSo as you can see the Chase \\'s claim \" Weve identified reasons your arent receiving our texts. \\'\\' is completely untrue and the supporting arguments they provided in their response to my CFPB complaint were known to them not to be true at the time Chase was writing their response.',\n   'I closed all 3 family Chase accounts in late XXXX of 2019.
